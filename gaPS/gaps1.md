Summary 
He definitely has experience with different technologies. 
But, as I see, he has a lot of gaps in theory, any question he did not know he switched theme to known one, assume there is no full understanding even on simple things like 
collection why and what should we choose. 
Patterns that he named, could not describe, only like main idea, no understanding what for they were used and how to implement. 
Tasks understands literally, do not try to ask or even do not know what to do with them (linq query, sql query, api case). 

Suggestion for a candidate: 
Learn theory to know what you can use when it will be needed and the main thing â€“ 
why and what should we choose. 
Working with the technologies, look around and try to understand how all this work.
